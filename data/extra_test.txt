Some people like living in the city because city life has many advantages.
They think there are more job opportunities in cities，
life there is more colorful and meaningful than that in the country ，
and there are more modern conveniences in cities for people to enjoy.
But some other people prefer to live in the countryside.
They say life in the countryside is closer to nature and better for their health，
life there is quieter and that country people are more honest than city people.
I would like to live in a city when I am young to earn enough money and I live in the countryside when I am old for having a quite life.
